4-Wire-FAN-Arduino
==================

4-Wire FAN control with Arduino ATmega328P/ATtiny85

You can choose duty cycle by setting OCR0B where max value is 0CR0A.

PWM (Fast PWM Mode) generates one 500nS pulse even when duty cycle is 0.

With ATtiny85 you can choose PWM - Phase Correct which generates no pulse when 0.
